Malcom X (Malcom Little) was born on May 19, 1925 in Omaha, Nebraska. He had a stay at home mom and his minister father Earl Little who was a big supporter of the Black Nationalist Leader Marcus Garvey. His father’s support for Garvey put his family in a lot of danger to a white supremacist group called Black Legion who threatened their lives. This forced Earl to move his family twice to keep them safe. Unfortunately relocating didn’t protect the family, in 1929 his home in Lansing, Michigan was burned to the ground and 2 years later Earl Little was found dead on the town’s train tracks. The police concluded it was an accident but the Little family thought otherwise. After his father’s death, Malcom’s mother Louise had several emotional breakdowns and was put into a mental institution. Malcom and his siblings were split up into different houses and orphanages.

 Malcom X was not always an honorable person, in 1946 him in his friend Malcom Jarvis were sentenced to 10 years in prison for burglary. In prison Malcom used that time to educate himself and followed the Muslim religion because his brother was apart of a religious group called the Nation of Islam. Being curious, Malcom looked into what their leader Elijah Muhammed taught. After being released from jail Malcolm became a minister, friend of Elijah Muhammed, and was a firm believer of the Nation of Islam.
